# Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

I have used Git specifically for version control and managing coding projects and repositories (personal and school work) with Github.

# Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

I personally use the Command Line Interface the most via the integrated terminal in VS Code, but at times I also use the integrated Source Control feature in VS Code if I need a more visual perspective in staging, committing, and pushing changes.

# What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

I learned a more in-depth analogy on how staging, committing, and pushing works:

- staging (git add) is like how a parcel is being prepared for delivery and putting items in the shipping box (choosing the files that you want to commit).
- committing (git commit) is when the parcel is then sealed and has a descriptive label on it (permanently records your staged code locally).
- pushing (git push) is when you hand over the parcel to the delivery driver to be delivered to its destination (code changes are then sent and saved to your Github repository online).
