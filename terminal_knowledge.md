# Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I chose Git Bash as my preferred terminal client. It is because having a Linux-like command-line environment while using a Windows machine really helps running Git commands smoothly. It gives me access to standard Linux-based utilities like `cd`, `grep`, and `ls` alongside being my main integrated terminal in VS Code.

# What customizations (if any) did you make?

I decided to use the default Git Bash configuration since it is satisfactory for me. I want to get a feel of the standard environment and commands first before delving into customization.

# What was the most useful command you learned today?

The most useful command I learned is `touch` (i.e. touch test.md). It allows me to create a new file just from the terminal, which conveniently lets me keep my hands on the keyboard and keep my workflow intact.
