# Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

I believe that Focus Bear was created for the pure intention of helping people who struggle with neurodivergent tendencies, as that of ADHD,, in navigating through daily routines productively, punctually, and peacefully. This app is here to help fight off distractions and foster a productive lifestyle.

# What problem is Focus Bear solving?

Focus Bear is actively solving the issue of distraction, unproductivity, and lack of focus especially when using you device such as smartphones and computers.

# Why do you think this mission is important?

Many people struggle in keeping themselves in line with the task at hand. Due to distractions and other factors of unproductivity, completing these tasks serve to be bothersome and difficult than they should be, and even at times cannot be completed at all. So with Focus Bear and its mission, solving these issues does not only help people complete tasks alone, but also improve their quality of life.

# How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

I truly believe and support what Focus Bear aims to achieve. As someone who also struggles with the lack of focus and distractions, this is also an important advocacy for me and other people experiencing productivity problems. To have an application that assists you daily in combating these issues is a daily win for many.

# Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes, most especially when it comes to distractions and focusing on the task at hand. I tend to find myself to start a task just to leave them halfway unfinished to start another one. SO with that, Focus Bear sounds like it's for me.

# Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?

Yes, I do. My older brother was diagnosed to have ADHD 2 years ago, but the signs were present since his childhood. Although he is brilliant when it comes to being booksmart, there are just some schoolwork and tasks that just has him delaying himself from starting them, or leaving them unfinished halfway. With what Focus Bear advocates for, I do think that this application can be a guide for him in keeping himself in track for the day.
