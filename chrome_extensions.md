# Which extensions did you install? Why?
I installed the following extensions:

- **React Developer Tools**: To easily inspect the React component tree, including the current props and state of individual components, without needing to heavily rely on console logs.
- **Redux DevTools**: To debug application state changes. It is incredibly useful for tracking actions.
- **JSON Viewer**: To automatically format, color-code, and collapse raw JSON responses from APIs directly in the browser tab, making them instantly readable.
- **Lighthouse**: To run comprehensive audits on web pages for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. It helps ensure that the built web application is optimized.

# What was the most useful thing you learned?
The most useful thing I learned is how powerful these tools are for eliminating guesswork during development. Instead of manually logging data to see what an API returns or what a component is rendering, tools like the JSON Viewer and React DevTools surface that information visually and interactively. I also found it fascinating that Lighthouse doesn't just give your web app a performance score, but actually provides specific, actionable steps on how to fix the exact code causing the bottleneck.
