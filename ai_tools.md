# Which AI tools did you try?

I tried using GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude AI. I asked each of them to generate code, solve a coding problem, and give explanations.

# What worked well? What didn’t?

What worked well is how they are able to explain the code that they wrote, especially if you request for simpler explanations when it comes to more complex problems. What didn't work as well, which is a case-to-case basis, is how they write the code. They may give working code, but at times it can be quite inefficient. Other times it just doesn't work, so you have to reprompt and be more specific with your requests.

# When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

I believe that AI is a useful coding partner, especially when you are stuck or when you do not understand certain concepts of your task. The caveat here is to not fully rely on AI to write the code for you, but rather help you understand your own work and even elevate it.
